# hello-world
first repository, learning, gitHub basic

Hello fellow humans, I am Omey, the one and only.
Sometimes I like to end sentences on .

I like coding, photography, editing, leagueoflegends, anime, manga. 
Pretty much normal in my view. 
I learn stuff pretty fast and I like that most.
I do not have glasses, if you are wondering ':D
